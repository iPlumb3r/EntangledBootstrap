2-level model
==

General
-
Mapping a __ecosystem__ essentially consists of identifying __"WHO? does WHAT?, HOW? and WHY?"__.

The answer to each of these questions can advantageously be provided via a __"2-level" model__ :
* A 1st level which calls upon __"Intentional"__ concepts (relating to the __finality__ of the thing).
* A 2nd level that calls upon __"Extensional"__ concepts (relating to the __nature__ of the thing)

Simplified model :
! [Basic Model](https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EntangledBootstrap_Topincs/blob/master/images/BasicModel_2020-02-11.png)


For example, the answer to the question "WHO?"   
is given at the 1st level by the concept __intentional__ #Agent (= "the thing that acts (whatever its nature)")
then it is completed at the 2nd level by different concepts __extensionals__.   
Classically it can be about the following concepts:
* #Person: A particular individual   
* #Organization: A set of #Person or #Organization #   
But potentially it can just as well be one or the other of the following concepts: 
* #Project: Specific initiative of a #Person or #Organization #  
* #Software: A software-type product (e.g. an AI instance that performs taxonomies)   
* #Product: Hardware type product (ex: a self-contained "taxi" car that offers trips)   

The answer to the question "WHAT?"    
is answered at the 1st level by the concept __intentional__ #Deliverable (="the thing that is delivered/developed/specified (regardless of its nature)")
then is completed at the 2nd level by different __extensions__ concepts that take into account "the nature of the thing" (at a more or less detailed level depending on the need): #Product, #Service, ... 

A similar "mechanics" applies for the answer to the other questions ...

Advantages
-
This two-level approach has the advantage that an intentional model can be defined that is "orthogonal" (= independent) to the extensional model.

This provides a generic ecosystem description model that can be specialized according to the type of ecosystem to be mapped.

Note: Note the extensional model itself may have a certain level of genericity if it is possible to manage in the form of taxonomies the different concepts that are potential candidates for being classes of the ontology.    
Example: #Product hasType #ProductType (Software, Hardware, ...)   
=> This possibility depends on the need (or not) to manage particular relationships between these concepts.
